    <p><img src="/images/maya.jpg" style="float: right; max-width: 25%; margin-left: 15px;" /> My name is Maya, and this is <em>The Present</em> - a small, independent, online Arts and Crafts business, based in Newlyn, near Penzance in Cornwall (UK).</p>

    <p>I make and sell a variety of unique, original, hand-crafted gifts, cards, and artwork that you won't find anywhere else on the high-street.</p>

    <p>Providing a first class, friendly service, I aim to take the footwork out of shopping round for those special gifts.</p>

    <p>Commissions are always welcome - I can customise; work with your ideas and favourite colours; and personalise
    
    most pieces upon request.</p>
    
    <p>All orders come gift-wrapped, and I can also include, free of charge, a miniature gift card with a personal message
    from you if you'd like me to post directly on to someone else (this saves you having to pay postage twice!). I will
    even photograph your gift-wrapped order with the little card to show you how it all looks before I post it off!</p>


    <p>Please do take a look through my <a href="https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/thepresents">Etsy</a> shop - see if there's anything you like. If not, let me know what you have in mind - I'll be more than happy to work with your ideas and help you create them!</p>

    <p>If you'd like to keep updated with my current work, you can find me on <a href="https://facebook.com/ThePresent.Arts.Crafts">Facebook</a> ('Liking' my page would be most appreciated!), also via <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Maya-Hayward-Mixed-Media-Artist-1698961527058166">Mixed Media Art</a>, <a href="https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/thepresents">Etsy</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ThePresentArts">Twitter</a> and <a
            href="https://uk.pinterest.com/mayathepresent/">Pinterest</a>.</p>
    <p>As a final note, Cornwall is a beautiful place to visit, if you're ever over this way! Have a lovely week &#x263A;</p>
